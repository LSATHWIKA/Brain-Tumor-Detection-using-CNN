# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-CNN
This project focuses on classifying brain MRI scans into tumor and non-tumor categories using deep learning techniques. A pre-trained VGG-16 model is fine-tuned for binary classification, trained on labeled MRI data, and evaluated using accuracy, performance metrics, and test set predictions to assess real-world reliability overall.
